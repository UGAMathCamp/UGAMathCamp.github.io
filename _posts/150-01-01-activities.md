<h2> Activities </h2>

<br />

This year's program will feature activity groups led by [Juanita Pinz√≥n Caicedo](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~juanita/), [Ester Dalvit](http://www.math.toronto.edu/dalvit/), [Juan Gutierrez](http://euler.math.uga.edu/lab/html/index_en.html), [Paul Pollack](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~pollack/), Barbara Remmers and Amber Russell. Some of the group descriptions are available below:

**Primes**
(Paul Pollack)

<blockquote>
We will explore several solved and unsolved problems about the set of prime numbers, ranging from classical results known to Euclid in 300 BCE to spectacular advances from just the past few years.

**Problem Solvers** 
(Barbara Remmers)

<blockquote>
Whether or not you are interested in competition, math contest problems are a great tool to improve problem solving abilities.  The problems are interesting -- many are written by mathematicians to illustrate important ideas -- and satisfying to solve.   They start off easy and end with very hard ones so each contest has something for everyone.

<br />
<br />

This will be an active group where most of the time will be spent grappling with problems, with help, hints, and coaching.  Students must have completed an algebra course.

**Discovering Graph Theory** 
(Amber Russell)

<blockquote>
Through a series of guided learning projects and hands-on activities, students will discover the basic definitions and some famous results from the field of Graph Theory. Specific topics include planar graphs, graph embeddings on surfaces, and the Four Color Theorem.
