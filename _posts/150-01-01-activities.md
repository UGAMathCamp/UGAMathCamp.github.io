<h2> Activities </h2>

This year's program will consist of 6 or 7 groups with faculty organizers including [Juanita Pinz√≥n Caicedo](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~juanita/), [Juan Gutierrez](http://euler.math.uga.edu/lab/html/index_en.html), [Paul Pollack](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~pollack/) and Amber Russell.

In addition, 
this year one of our groups will be run by Barbara Remmers and will be aimed particularly at middle school students, on problem solving and math contest problems. Remmers describes her group activity as follows:

<blockquote>
Whether or not you are interested in competition, math contest problems are a great tool to improve problem solving abilities.  The problems are interesting -- many are written by mathematicians to illustrate important ideas -- and satisfying to solve.   They start off easy and end with very hard ones so each contest has something for everyone.

<br />
<br />


This will be an active group where most of the time will be spent grappling with problems, with help, hints, and coaching.  Students must have completed an algebra course.
</blockquote>

If you are interested in participating in her group, please indicate this in the "additional comments" section of the registration form, or, if you have already registered, by emailing the camp organizers at <a href="mailto:ugamathcamp@gmail.com">ugamathcamp@gmail.com</a>
