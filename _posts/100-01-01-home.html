<h4>What and Who</h4>
<p>At MathCamp, UGA faculty mentors each work with a graduate student helper,
and and undergraduate helper guiding a group of roughly 5 high school
students on exploratory projects in a range of topics. We plan to have 5 or
6 groups, for a total of 25-30 students. 
</p>
<p>
Topics vary year to year, but in
the past, they have included topology, graph theory, number theory,
cryptography, mathematical problem solving, and mathematical biology.
<p>

<br />
<br />

<h4>When and Where</h4>
<p>MathCamp 2016 will be running Monday, May 30 to Friday, June 3, in the Boyd
Graduate Studies Research Building (200 D.W. Brooks Drive), at the
University of Georgia Athens Campus.
</p>
<p>Camp starts at 9:30am each day, and will run until 3:30pm, though
participants will also have the option of staying until 5:30pm</p>.

<br />
<br />

<h4>How</h4>
<p>MathCamp is funded by <a
href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1151252&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF
CAREER grant DMS-1151252</a>,
and this grant pays for all student activities with the exception of food
and t-shirts.</p>

<p>Participants will pay a fee of $40 at the beginning of
