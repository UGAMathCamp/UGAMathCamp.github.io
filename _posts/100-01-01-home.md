**Welcome to the UGA MathCamp page!** 

At MathCamp, UGA faculty mentors each work with a graduate student helper,
and and undergraduate helper guiding a group of roughly 5 high school
students on exploratory projects in a range of topics. We plan to have 5 or
6 groups, for a total of 25-30 students. Topics vary year to year, but in
the past, they have included topology, graph theory, number theory,
cryptography, mathmatical problem solving, and mathematical biology.

MathCamp 2016 will be running Monday, May 30 to Friday, June 3, in the Boyd
Graduate Studies Research Building (200 D.W. Brooks Drive), at the
University of Georgia Athens Campus.

MathCamp is funded by [NSF CAREER grant
DMS-1151252](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1151252&HistoricalAwards=false).
