**Welcome to the UGA MathCamp page!** 

At MathCamp, UGA faculty mentors each work with a graduate student helper,
and and undergraduate helper guiding a group of roughly 5 high school
students on exploratory projects in a range of topics. We plan to have 5 or
6 groups, for a total of 25-30 students. Topics vary year to year, but in
the past, they have included topology, graph theory, number theory, and
mathematical biology.

Our next weeklong camp will run during the summer of 2016. If you are
interested in information about our next camp, please fill out the mailing
list form below!
